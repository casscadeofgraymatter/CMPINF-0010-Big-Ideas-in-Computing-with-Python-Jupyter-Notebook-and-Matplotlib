# 🌿 Climate Soldiers
## Final Project – CMPINF 0010: Big Ideas in Computing

- **Authors:** Cassandra Gray (cmg180@pitt.edu) and Saajan Gandhi (sag205@pitt.edu)
- **Course:** CMPINF 0010 – Big Ideas in Computing  
- **Tools Used:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib

## 📘 Introduction
This project explores what makes a neighborhood in Pittsburgh **eco-friendly** by analyzing three key environmental factors:
- **Smart Trash Containers** – Promoting efficient waste management
- **Greenways** – Providing sustainable public green space
- **Food Gardens** – Supporting local food production and community engagement
Our goal was to determine which neighborhood demonstrates the strongest commitment to sustainability by analyzing how prevalent these features are across different zip codes.

## 📊 Methodology
Using Python and `pandas`, we:
1. Loaded and cleaned three open datasets from the [Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center](https://data.wprdc.org/).
2. Grouped and counted occurrences of each eco-feature by zip code or neighborhood.
3. Visualized results using `matplotlib` bar charts and tables.
4. Identified top-performing neighborhoods in each category.
We added visual spice (with GIFs and color coding) to make data science a bit more fun and engaging!
